# My Personal Project

## A Monty Hall Simulation

In my STAT 302: Introduction to Probability, we talked about the Monty Hall game show
situation. To read more about the setup of the game, you can visit:
https://statisticsbyjim.com/fun/monty-hall-problem/. During class, we analyzed the 
mathematics behind it, and our TA mentioned briefly: "It would be cool to build
some kind of simulation, where you can run the options of 'switch' or 'no switch' 
numerous times, and you would be able to show that the math (though counter-intuitive)
is true." My application would be a dashboard where you can fully learn the Monty Hall 
problem interactively. It will include:

- A first round where users simply play through the game show as a regular contestant.
- Then, users can choose to run a simulation of the game 100, 500, or 1000 times.
- A small counter on the right will display the win vs lose record of their decision.
- Lastly, the mathematics behind the process will be displayed in an interesting way.

This project is very interesting to me as I am an avid mathematics tutor/teacher 
in my spare time. I would like to extend my help to students who may struggle with 
math in one way or another through this application. Hence, potential users of this 
program will be students who want to understand the Monty Hall problem better. Hopefully,
this can also be a way for me to practice my upper-year level statistics skills too.
